# binaries GDAL Csharp
GDAL compiled with C#/Mono bindings, for linux.

GDAL ships with [C# bindings](https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/GdalOgrInCsharp) - however their compilation is not straightforward for linux. This repository aims to fill this gap by providing reasonably up-to-date, pre-compiled GDAL bindings for C#. Current bindings are for GDAL 2.1.1.
